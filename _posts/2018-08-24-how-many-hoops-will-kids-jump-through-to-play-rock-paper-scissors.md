> Let’s call this game rock-paper-scissors-hop. Here is an idealized list of its rules:
>
>    - Kids stand at either end of N hoops.
>    - At the start of the game, one kid from each end starts hopping at a speed of one hoop per second until they run into each other, either in adjacent hoops or in the same hoop.
>    - At that point, they play rock-paper-scissors at a rate of one game per second until one of the kids wins.
>    - The loser goes back to their end of the hoops, a new kid immediately steps up at that end, and the winner and the new player hop until they run into each other.
>    - This process continues until someone reaches the opposing end. That player’s team wins!
