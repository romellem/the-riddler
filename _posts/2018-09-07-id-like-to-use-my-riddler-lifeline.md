# I’d Like To Use My Riddler Lifeline 

> ([source](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/id-like-to-use-my-riddler-lifeline/))
>
> From Tom Hanrahan, some big-money game show strategizing:
>
> You are a contestant on “Who Wants to Be a Riddler Millionaire.” You have already made it to
> a late round: You could walk away right now with $250,000. But there are two potential questions
> still to go that you can try to answer. You could earn $500,000 if you get one right and then
> walk away, or $1 million if you nail them both. If you attempt any answer and miss, you go home
> with $10,000.
>
> Luckily, you still have two of your lifelines:
>
>  *  The 50/50: The host reduces the four possible answers to two; one of them is the correct one and the other is randomly chosen from among the other three answers.
>  *  Ask the Audience: The studio audience submits their own guesses. You know historically that the correct answer will be chosen by the plurality 50 percent of the time; while 30 percent of the time the right answer finishes second; 15 percent third; and 5 percent last. Additionally, if there are only two answers available to the audience, they pick the correct one more often 65 percent of the time.
>
> The problem: You’re burned out. All the pressure and questions you’ve already answered have made
> you a babbling mess. You assess that you would have no clue on the last two questions,
> so you’ll be guessing randomly.
>
> What is your best strategy to play, or stop, or use your lifelines to maximize your expected winnings?
